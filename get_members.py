"""
This script defines the classes Member and Memberlist which are needed by
the script "create_accounts.py".

When run on its own this script will read a csv/tsv file given by the variable
"memberlist" and print all the members that were admitted in the term given
by the variable "current_term".

IMPORTANT! Before running create_accounts.py you must check that the indices
of the variable 'cells' in the 'fill_info' method of the class 'Member'
correspond to the correct columns in the csv/tsv file.
